      systems of communications.

    <h1>Modern Technology:</h1>
    <p>
      Technology is advancing at an exponential rate year after year. Our modern forms of technology have made some actions obsolete.
      One of the major societal impacts it has is on our socialization. We went hear say, trusting others to tell the right story, to mail systems,
      to landline phones, to now being able to send messages as fast as you can type it from anywhere to anywhere to anyone.
      It is a true marvel that we need to look at very carefully. With anything we need to ask ourselves important questions. 
      <ul>
        <li>Can we trsut all forms of technology?</li>
        <li>What are the drawbacks of instant messaging?</li>
        <li>Should we regulate new technology before it is too late?</li>
        <li>What ages are appropriate for certain technology?</li>
