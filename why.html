            <h1>Why was choosing a website important?</h1>
            <h2>Choosing a website was an important, if not the most crucial, aspect of this project.
                Since my whole project revolves around technology and how it efects our socialization it fit to put in an example that is almost a every 
                day use of technology. It has all the basic pros and cons that helps raises the important ethical questions we need tot alk about as well
                as highlighting the benefits a website can bring to a learning envirment and everyday life.
            </h2>
            <h1> </h1>
            <h2>The thought process was since it is going to be a presentation you can follow along by having access to all the information up front. You can 
                explore it all, go at your own pace, not look at it at all, or even not listen at all and explore it all by yourself. The pros of this is you will
                always have access to the information and you can reference it at any time. The cons is that the only way to access it is through technology, 
                so you'll need a device, internet or data access, the appropriate link, and the time to sit and look at it. If you decide to look at it alone
                you also do not have the author of the information to present and explain it so you are limited in that sense.
